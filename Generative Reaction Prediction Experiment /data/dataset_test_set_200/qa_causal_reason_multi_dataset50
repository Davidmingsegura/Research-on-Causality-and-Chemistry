"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: O=CC1=CC=C2OCOC2=C1, second reactant: COC1=CC(=CC(OC)=C1OC)C(C)=O, The reagent: sodium hydroxide, Temperature: 20°C, Time: 6 hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: methanol. Other Conditions: Inert atmosphere; Reflux. Also, the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: NaOH (160 mg, 4.0 mmol) was added to a solution of substituted benzaldehydes 1 (2.0 mmol) in MeOH (20 mL) at rt. Then aryl methylketones 2a-p (2.05 mmol) or tert-butyl methyl ketones 2q-v (2.05 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 6 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to yield the residue. The residue was extracted with EtOAc (330 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried, filtered, and evaporated to afford crude skeleton 3 with quantitative yields. Without further purification, reduction of crude skeleton 3 was treated with NaBH4 in the next step. Synthesis of skeleton 3 is a known protocol and the related analytical data are consistent with those in the literature.5a,b. The SMILES answer is: COC1=CC(=CC(OC)=C1OC)C(=O)\C=C\C1=CC=C2OCOC2=C1

"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: O=CC1=CC=C2OCOC2=C1, second reactant: CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1, The reagent: potassium hydroxide, Temperature: 20°C, Time: unknown hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: ethanol; water. Other Conditions: unknown. Also, the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: The cold solution of 0.893 g KOH (0.01 mol) in 6.5 mL of distilled water was addeddropwise into a solution of 3.65 mmol of acetophenone derivatives in 3 mL of ethanol. Atotal of 3.65 mmol of benzaldehyde derivatives in 3 mL of ethanol was then introducedinto the mixture and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. The mixture wasthen cooled in an ice bath. The formed solid product was filtered, recrystallized frommethanol, and dried. The purity and product characterizations were performed using TLC(dichloromethane:n-hexane = 4:1), FTIR spectrometry, MS, 1H-, and 13C-NMR.. The SMILES answer is: O=C(\C=C\C1=CC2=C(OCO2)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1

"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: O=CC1=CC=C2OCOC2=C1, second reactant: CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1, The reagent: sodium hydroxide, Temperature: 20°C, Time: 48 hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: ethanol. Other Conditions: unknown. Also, the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: Saturated ethanolic NaOH (20 mL) was added under stirringto a solution of acetophenone (3; 250 mg, 2.08 mmol) andappropriate benzaldehydes (4a-w; 2.70 mmol) in ethanol(2.5 mL). The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature.After, the reaction mixture was neutralized withHCl 5% until pH ≈ 7 and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50mL). Then, the organic layer was dried, concentrated, andpurified by flash column chromatography using hexane:EtOAc (1:0-1:1) as eluent, to obtain the correspondingchalcones (5a-w). The compounds 6o-r were obtainedusing acidic media (see Electronic Supplementary Material).. The SMILES answer is: O=C(\C=C\C1=CC2=C(OCO2)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1

Other Conditions: unknown. Also, the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All chalcone derivatives (3a-w) were obtained according to proceedings reported by our research group previously,(Mellado et al. 2020, Mellado, Madrid, Martinez, et al. 2018a, Mellado, Madrid, Reyna, et al. 2018a, Mellado et al. 2021) Briefly,250 mg of acetophenone (2.08 mmol) and appropriate benzaldehyde (1.2 equivalents) were solubilized in ethanol (5 mL) and added 10 mL of a saturated NaOH solution. This mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, and, after this time, a 5% HCl solution was added until pH= 7.0 to stop reaction. Finally, mixture was extracted with EtOAc (50 mL x 3) and separated. The organic layer was dried, concentrated and purified using column chromatography in order to obtain the corresponding chalcones.. The SMILES answer is: O=C(\C=C\C1=CC2=C(OCO2)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1
