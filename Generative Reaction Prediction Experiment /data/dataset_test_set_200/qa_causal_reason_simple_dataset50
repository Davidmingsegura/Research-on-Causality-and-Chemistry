Other Conditions: unknown. Also, the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: TBHP (5-6 M in decane, 0.48 mmol) was added dropwise to a mixture of β-ketoesters 1 (0.48 mmol), hydroxamic acids 2(0.40 mmol), and MgCl2 (3.8 mg, 0.040 mmol) in MeCN (2mL). The reaction was stirred at 40 C for the indicated time;reaction completion was confirmed based on thedisappearance of hydroxamic acids (Table 2). Then thereaction mixture was cooled to r.t., quenched with aqNaHSO3 solution and extracted with CH2Cl2 three times.The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrousNa2SO4, filtered, and then concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography to afford amination product 3. This General Experimental Procedure was carried out using 1a (69.2 mg, 0.48 mmol) and 2a (53.2mg, 0.40 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 34 h at 40 C and purified by silica gel chromatography using PE-CH2Cl2-EtOAc (4:1:0.75) as eluent to give product 3a (94.3mg, 85%) as a colorless oil. The structure of 3a was identified by comparison of its 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra with the reported data in ref. 8. See the Supporting Information for experimental details and characterization data for all new compounds.. The SMILES answer is: CC(=O)C(C)(N(O)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C
