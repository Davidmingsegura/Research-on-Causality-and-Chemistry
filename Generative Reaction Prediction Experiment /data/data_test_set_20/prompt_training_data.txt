Solvent was then evaporated and the dried crude products were crystallized from 95% ethanol, except for nitro-chalcones, which were crystallized from acetone, filtrated and finally dried under vacuum for 48 h. The melting points of the isolated products were measured on a Reichert-Heizbank apparatus. The yields of the reactions were determined by gas chromatography on a Shimadzu 2014-GC apparatus using chloroform as solvent. The capillary column was DB-5 and the carrier gas was nitrogen. The SMILES answer is : COC1=CC=CC=C1\C=C\C(=O)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1

The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and partitioned between brine (25 mL) and CH2Cl2 (3 × 15 mL) and solid SSA was filtered off. The SSA was washed with acetone (25 mL) to ensure desorption of product on SSA surface. The combined organic extract was washed with brine (3 × 25 mL) and the organic extract was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the chalcone as colorless solid (1.48 g, 91%).",ClC1=CC=CC(C=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C3C2=O)=C1,"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: ClC1=CC(C=O)=CC=C1, second reactant: O=C1CCCC2=C1C=CC=C2, Temperature: 65°C, Time: 1.5 hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: neat (no solvent).
