Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36.

We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture.

The general reaction scheme is depicted in Scheme 1.Method A: 20% NaOH (5 ml) was added dropwise to a previously cooled mixture of 5 mmol of selected acetophenone and 5 mmol of selected benzaldehyde in 25 ml ethanol under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24-72 h. After completion of the reaction as indicated by TLC, the mixture was poured onto crushed ice and acidified with dilute HCl. Precipitated product was filtered by suction and washed to neutral.

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.
