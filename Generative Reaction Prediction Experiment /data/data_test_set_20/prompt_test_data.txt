The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water to afford the crude product, which was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography (5% MeOH/DCM) to give Flav-NH2 as a dark purple solid (0.264 g, 90 %).1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ = 8.61 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 1H), 8.24 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.92 (d, J = 9.5 Hz, 1H), 7.89 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 1H), 7.35 (dd, J = 9.5, 2.0 Hz, 1H), 7.28 (s, 1H), 6.85 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 3.71 (q, J = 7.0 Hz, 4H), 1.30 (t, J = 14.0 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ = 168.2, 158.2, 157.1, 154.9, 147.7, 132.2, 131.9, 116.1, 115.7, 115.4, 114.8, 108.2, 96.4, 45.5, 12.9. HRMS (ESI) calcd for C19H21N2O [M]+ 293.1648, found 293.1647. The SMILES answer is : CCN(CC)C1=CC=C2C=CC(=[O+]C2=C1)C1=CC=C(N)C=C1

"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: O=CC1=CC=CS1, second reactant: CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1, Temperature: 0°C, Time: unknown hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: methanol; water. Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: In a 10 mL flask at 0 C was added a 5:1 MeOH-H2O mixture (6 mL), 85% KOH aqueous solution and benzaldehyde (6 mmol, 1.2 eq). Then acetophenone (5 mmol) was added dropwise over a period of 10 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5-48 hours at 0 C and then quenched with an aqueous solution of NH4Cl (20 mL), extracted with AcOEt (4 x 30 mL). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and then concentrated.",O=C(\C=C\C1=CC=CS1)C1=CC=CC=C1,"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: O=CC1=CC=CS1, second reactant: CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1, Temperature: 0°C, Time: unknown hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: methanol; water.
