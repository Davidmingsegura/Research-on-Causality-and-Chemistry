Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: This procedure is suitable to compounds that not contain free phenolic groups or when the phenolic groups are protected as methyl or benzylethers.To a solution of the corresponding 2'-hydroxyacetophenone (10 mmol) in dry THF (25 mL), NaH (25 mmol, 1 g of 60% dispersion in mineral oil) was added in portions, under a nitrogen atmosphere and with vigorous stirring. When the evolution of H2 ceased, a solution of the corresponding benzaldehyde (10 mmol) in dry THF (25 mL) was added dropwise over 15 min and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h, except otherwise stated. After this, the mixture was poured cautiously over ice-water (100 mL) to destroy the excess of NaH and stirred until the evolution of H2 subsided. The mixture was acidified with 25% HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (3 × 50 mL), brine (50 mL), and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solution was concentrated under vacuum at 40 C, until it reached 1/3 of the original volume. After cooling at 0 C for 12 h the crystalline product was separated by filtration. The 2'-hydroxychalcones obtained in this way are pure enough for most purposes. Analytical samples were obtained after purification by column chromatography.Using this procedure, good yields of chalcones were obtained. An additional amount of product can be obtained from the mother liquors. To this end, the solvent was removed under vacuum and the compound was purified by column chromatography.
