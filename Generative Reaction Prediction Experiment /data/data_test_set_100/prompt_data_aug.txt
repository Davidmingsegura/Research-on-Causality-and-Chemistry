Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36.

[0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A mixture of the suitable aldehyde (1.0 mmol), acetophenone (1.0 mmol) and clay catalyst(240 mg) was warmed at 150 C in a sealed tube under microwave irradiation, for 1 h. In the reactions involving solid starting materials, they were thoroughly mixed by grinding in a mortar before irradiation. The reaction mixture was diluted with hot ethanol (20 mL), the catalyst was filtered off, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was purified by crystallization (EtOH) for solid chalcones(compounds 3a-3d, 3f-3m, 3p-3ar) or by column chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate/hexanes) for oily chalcones (compounds 3e, 3o), to afford the pure final products. All yields were calculated from isolated products. Characterization data for previously unknown compounds are given below. For full characterization data, see the Supporting Information.

"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: ClC1=CC=CC=C1C=O, second reactant: CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1, Temperature: unknown°C, Time: unknown hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: ethanol; water. Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils. For each of the reported compounds below, the 1H NMR data is presented as δ (multiplicity, integral ratio), and the IR data as νCO, νCC. The following % yield and physical data are for new chalcones prepared for this study. Data for other chalcones (not given below) have been reported elsewhere[4], [5] and [6] and are also available online as Supplementary data. The SMILES answer is : ClC1=CC=CC=C1\C=C\C(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: We have previously reported the synthesis of DHC via Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction using NaOH as base in refluxing ethanol [13] . However, this procedure was not suitable for the preparation of the other chalcone derivatives used in the cur- rent study (DC, DC-COOH, and DHC-COOH). Therefore, we opti- mized the synthesis using piperidine (instead of NaOH) in refluxing ethanol as depicted in Scheme 1 . For the newly synthesized chalones (DC, DC-COOH, and DHC-COOH), an equimolar concentration (1 mmol) of 4- dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and ketone (acetophenone, 4- acetylbenzoic acid, or 4-acetyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (10 mL) and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 5 minutes, followed by portion-wise addition of piperidine (6-8) equivalents. The reaction mixture was monitored by TLC using ethylacetate/toluene (5%) for DC and MeOH/DCM (5%) for DC-COOH and DHC-COOH as eluent and the reactions were completed within 48-96 hours. All reactions were subjected to the following procedure; the reaction mixture was poured in a beaker charged with a small amount of ice. The round-bottomed flask was rinsed with distilled water in order to collect out most of the precipitates. The resulting mixture was neutralized by dropwise addition of diluted hydrochloric acid (0.5 M) and the product was precipitated. The precipitate was filtered offthrough a Büchner funnel, air dried and the final product was collected. The DC product was purified by preparative TLC (10 0 0 μm plate) using ethylacetate/toluene (5%) as eluent, while the other two products (DC-COOH and DHC-COOH) were washed with diethyl ether to produce the targeted chalcones in 34-61% isolated yield. Well-defined crystals of DC were obtained after five days by dissolving the solid in a small portion of warm ethanol (50 C), followed by cooling to room temperature.

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome. As such, by rising the temperature to 40 or 70 C., and by optimizing the work-up procedure, we were able to obtain the pure chalcones 37-51 in reasonable to excellent yield after crystallization in ethanol (see table 3).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: A solution of the acetophenone (10 mmol) and LiOH.H2O (10 mol %) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol is stirred at the appropriate temperature for 10 min (for reactions at 40 C., the bulb is equipped with a reflux condenser). Then, the benzaldehyde (10 mmol, 1 equiv.) is added and the system is protected from the atmosphere with a cork stopper. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC or LCMS-analysis; during the course of the reaction, the chalcone may precipitate. Upon attaining maximum conversion grade, the reaction mixture is quenched with 15 mL of 1% hydrochloric acid. [0362] If the chalcone has precipitated, it is isolated by means of filtration. In order to remove residual amounts of benzaldehyde, the residue is washed thoroughly with water until the filtrate turns clear. The obtained solid is the chalcone, which can be dried in a dessicator. Subsequently, the chalcone can be recrystallized in absolute ethanol so as to obtain high purity crystals. [0363] If the chalcone has formed a separate oily liquor at the bottom of the bulb, it can be extracted from the mixture with diethyl ether. The organic phase is subsequently washed with brine (2×) and dried over MgSO4, upon which the solution is concentrated in vacuo. Again, purification of the thus obtained residue can be performed through recrystallization in absolute ethanol. [0369] The synthesis of compounds 37-51 was conducted via a Claisen-Schmidt condensation of suitably functionalized acetophenones and benzaldehydes. Whilst other syntheses have been proposed to prepare chalcones (e.g. via 1,3-diaryl-1-siloxy allenes or by Suzuki or Heck coupling reactions), this crossed aldol condensation remains the method of choice, given its simplicity and the ready availability of the required acetophenones 35 and benzaldehydes 36. Wherein R and R′ are as represented in table 3 Scheme: [0370] Chalcone synthesis. a) 1 equiv. benzaldehyde 36, 5 mol % LiOH.H2O, abs. EtOH., conditions see table 3. [0371] Over the years, numerous basic (e.g. NaOH, Ba(OH)2 and Al2O3) and acid (e.g. dry HCl and BF3) catalysts have been proposed for this transformation. We considered the LiOH.H2O catalyzed protocol as proposed by Bhagat and co-workers to be the most elegant, because of its high catalyst turnover and yields, short reaction times and easy work-up. Nevertheless, as we could only obtain the high yields reported by these researchers after prolonged reaction times, we evaluated the influence of the reaction temperature on its outcome.

All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight.

In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

Then aldehyde 2 (1.2 eq.) was charged into the reaction mixture to get the corresponding benzylidine derivative 3 (Scheme 1).

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: All syntheses were carried out in the same fashion. Each reaction was monitored by TLC for 24 h to determine when the starting materials had been consumed. All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight. The purity of the crude product was determined at this point using a combination of TLC analysis, melting point measurement, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture. In all cases, the purity of the final product was checked again as described above; the spectral characteristics were found to be in good general agreement with those found in the literature.4 The organic chalcones prepared for this study were either pale-yellow solids or oils of the same color (as specified); the ferrocenyl analogs were reddish-orange solids or oils.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24-72 h. After completion of the reaction as indicated by TLC, the mixture was poured onto crushed ice and acidified with dilute HCl. Precipitated product was filtered by suction and washed to neutral. The solid was recrystallised from dilute ethanol to get crystalline chalcone.Method B: To a mixture of 5 mmol of selected acetophenone and 5 mmol of selected benzaldehyde in 50 ml round bottom flask, 20 ml methanol and 35 mmol of LiOH was added. The reaction mixture was kept in an ultrasonic bath for 1-5 h, until reaction completion was indicated by TLC. The reaction was worked up as described for method A.

All TLC analyses were run on Selecto Scientific flexible silica gel-coated plates containing a fluorescent indicator and were developed using a hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) solution as the eluent. The following procedure is representative of the synthesis of all chalcones (see [Chart 1] and [Chart 2] for structures): A 25-mL round-bottomed flask was charged with the appropriate derivatives of both acetophenone (3 mmol) and benzaldehyde (3 mmol), and mixed with 10 mL of 95% EtOH. The mixture was then stirred magnetically while being gently heated (in a 30 C water bath) until both starting materials dissolved. In a separate flask, NaOH (3.5 mmol) was added to 10-mL of an ethanol-water (1:1) and the mixture was stirred magnetically until the solid dissolved. The NaOH solution was then added dropwise (using a Pasteur pipet) to the ethanolic solution of acetophenone and benzaldehyde described above. In most cases, the reaction mixture turned yellow and solidified within a few minutes. Ice water (2 mL) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously. The solid was collected on a Hirsch funnel, washed with cold water, and air-dried overnight.

In case of an oily product, the reaction mixture was extracted with two 10-mL portions of CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was collected, dried over Na2SO4, and removed using a rotary evaporator. The purity of the oily product was then determined as described above. All impure products (solid or oil) were purified by column chromatography using Merck Silica gel (grade 60, 230-400 mesh) and 4:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. In case of a solid, chromatographic separation was followed by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol-water mixture.

"Predict the product for the following reaction: First reactant: CC(=O)C1=CC=CO1, second reactant: COC1=CC=C(C=O)C=C1, Temperature: 20; 20°C, Time: unknown hours, Catalyst: unknown, Solvent: ethanol; ethanol. Also the procedure of the reaction was the following: General procedure: As shown in Scheme 1 , the required chalcone derivatives (3a-f, 4a-e, 4g, 5a-e, 5h, 6a-f and 6i) were synthesised via aq. KOH catalysed, Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction [37] between aromatic ketones (1a-d) with the aromatic aldehydes (2a-i) in the ethanol-water medium at room temperature (RT) for 20-24h. To earn the target chalcones, 1eq. of ketone (1a-d) was dissolved in 20eq. of ethanol and stirred for 5min. 10% KOH (1.5eq.) solution was added slowly to the stirring reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15min, and 1eq. of aldehyde (2a-i) dissolved in 20eq. of ethanol was added dropwise. Stirring was continued for 20-24h at RT, and TLC monitored the reaction progress in an 8:2 hexane-EtOAc solvent system. After the reaction completion, excess ethanol in the crude compound was concentrated, and the product was separated from the aqueous fraction by solvent extraction with EtOAc (3 times). The combined EtOAc layer was dried using anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the excess solvent was removed on concentration under vacuum conditions at 45C. The crude product was purified via silica gel column chromatography (silica gel 100-200 mesh size) using the hexane-EtOAc solvent system to earn the chalcones derivatives (3a-f, 4a-e, 4g, 5a-e, 5h, 6a-f and 6i) in 75-94% yields. The products ' starting materials, reaction time, product structure, appearance, yield, and melting point are tabulated in Table 1 . The IR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectrum of the synthesised chalcones are given in the SI file (Table SI 1 and Fig. SI 1-75). The SMILES answer is : COC1=CC=C(C=CC(=O)C2=CC=CO2)C=C1
